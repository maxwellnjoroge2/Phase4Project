# Loan Approval Prediction

This project investigates the relationship between applicant financial profiles and loan approval decisions through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. Our dataset includes various financial and demographic variables, such as credit score, annual income, employment status, debt-to-income ratio, and previous payment history, alongside loan-specific metrics like loan amount, interest rate, and risk score. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover patterns and key predictors that influence loan approvals and assess credit risk more effectively.

### **Key Questions Explored:**

1) **What are the strongest predictors of loan approval or rejection?**

2) **How does debt-to-income ratio impact loan approval, interest rates, and risk scores?**

3) **What are the financial and demographic profiles of high-risk versus low-risk applicants?**

4) **How does credit score impact interest rates, loan approval, and loan amount?**

5) **What is the relationship between loan purpose and repayment behavior, and how does it affect risk?**

These questions will guide our analysis, helping us understand the key financial behaviors impacting credit risk, loan terms, and approval likelihood. Insights from these questions aim to inform risk management and assist lenders in developing data-driven strategies for loan structuring and approval.
